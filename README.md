## What is `email-intel`?

`email-intel` is an incredibly fast, robust, and deep email verification suite designed to run anywhere. It provides critical intelligence on email addresses without ever sending an email. 

**Primary Capabilities:**
1. **Valid Email Verification**: Probes MX records in real-time to guarantee the domain can receive emails.
2. **Disposable & Temp Email Detection**: Blocks thousands of "burn-after-reading" temporary email services (like 10minutemail, GuerrillaMail).
3. **Provider Inference**: Detects backend providers (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Zoho, Proofpoint, Mimecast, etc.).
4. **Domain Intelligence**: Accurately classifies domains into `Business`, `Public Webmail`, `Education`, `Government`, or `Organization`.
5. **DNS Auditing**: Validates the presence of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC security records.

## 📊 Intelligence Report Schema

When you analyze an email address (e.g., `test@itshivam.in`), the library returns a comprehensive intelligence report. Here is the data dictionary and an example of the return values:

| Field | Type | Example Value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `email` | string | `"test@itshivam.in"` | The email address that was analyzed. |
| `domain` | string | `"itshivam.in"` | The extracted domain. |
| `valid` | boolean | `true` | **True** if the domain has MX records and is not disposable. |
| `provider` | string | `"Zoho Mail"` | The detected email provider behind the domain. |
| `type` | string | `"Business"` | Categorization (e.g., `Business`, `Public Webmail`, `Education`). |
| `mx` / `spf` / `dmarc` | boolean | `true` | **True** if the respective DNS security records were found. |
| `disposable` | boolean | `false` | **True** if the domain belongs to a temporary/burn-after-reading email service. |
| `risk` | string | `"low"` | Assessed risk level (`low`, `medium`, `high`) based on the score. |
| `score` | number | `100` | A score out of 100 indicating the trustworthiness of the email address. |

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions across all three ecosystems! Because we maintain feature parity, logic changes in one language often require replicating the logic in the other two.

### To Start Contributing:
1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Navigate to the language package you'd like to work on (`/js`, `/go`, or `/python`).
3. Make your changes and write/update tests if applicable.
4. If modifying the core intelligence logic (e.g. `inferProvider` or `determineDomainType`), please implement those exact changes in **all three languages** to maintain parity!
5. Open a Pull Request.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

A massive thank you to the open-source community for maintaining the massive datasets required to accurately flag domains. 

Specifically, this repository runs a daily automated cron job to fetch and normalize the latest domains from:
- [**disposable-email-domains/disposable-email-domains**](https://github.com/disposable-email-domains/disposable-email-domains) for their exhaustive list of temporary email providers.
- [**Kikobeats/free-email-domains**](https://github.com/Kikobeats/free-email-domains) for their comprehensive list of public webmail providers.

Without these incredibly well-maintained community lists, `email-intel` wouldn't be possible. Thank you!
